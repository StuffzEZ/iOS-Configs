# Stremio OCIFS App
Currently, On The iOS App Store, The Stremio App Is Not Fully Functional And Uses The Old Design.
To Fix This, I Have Created A MOBILECONFIG That Adds The Stremio Web App As A Fullscreen App On Any iOS Device It Is Installed On.
This MOBILECONFIG And The Apps Are Removable.

## Installation
Click The Link Below And Follow The Steps On Your Device.
<br>
[Install Config](https://stuffzez.github.io/iOS-Configs/WebApps/Stremio/OCIFS-Custom.mobileconfig)
<br>
This is connected to [OCIFS Stremio](), which means you will have to follow the steps below to activate it.

## OCIFS Activation
You should have been given an ocifs365 url. If you haven't, use the public one: s1.stremio.ocifs365.freemyip.com .
With this url, you will need to go to settings on the app, then streaming and change the Url to that URL.
