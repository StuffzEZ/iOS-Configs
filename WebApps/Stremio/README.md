# Stremio App
Currently, On The iOS App Store, The Stremio App Is Not Fully Functional And Uses The Old Design.
To Fix This, I Have Created A MOBILECONFIG That Adds The Stremio Web App As A Fullscreen App On Any iOS Device It Is Installed On.
This MOBILECONFIG And The Apps Are Removable.

## Installation
